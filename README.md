# 2048 but meh
you CAN do illegal moves! i DID add a way to check legal moves to spawn a new number cus im actually not that stupid 

:D

# Requirements
- python 3
- keyboard library
- a keyboard

# Known Issues
- when you press a movement key even it isn't a legal move, and the board actually doesn't change, it still saves the board making it impossible to undo.
